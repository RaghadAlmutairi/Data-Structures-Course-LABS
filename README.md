# Data-Structures-Course-LABS  
**University Course Labs for Data Structures (C++)**  
by **Raghad Almutairi** (2022)

---

## 📘 Overview  
This repository contains C++ lab assignments for a university Data Structures course.  
Each lab demonstrates a specific data structure or algorithm with clear, simple implementations.

The goal of these labs is to help students understand how common data structures work in C++ through hands-on examples.

## 📂 Repository Structure  
Below is a description of each lab file included in the repository.  
*(You may update each description once the exact lab content is confirmed.)*

| Lab File | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Lab1_DS.cpp** | Introduction to basic data structures: arrays, simple operations, and foundational logic. |
| **Lab2_DS.cpp** | Linear data structures such as stacks/queues and basic operations like push, pop, enqueue, dequeue. |
| **Lab3_DS.cpp** | Linked List implementation (singly or doubly). Covers insert, delete, traverse, search. |
| **Lab4_DS.cpp** | More advanced linked list operations or introduction to trees (binary tree basics and traversals). |
| **Lab8_DS.cpp** | Non-linear structures: trees or graphs. May include BST operations or graph traversal logic. |
| **Lab9_DS.cpp** | Builds on Lab8 with deeper algorithms: BFS, DFS, tree balancing, or advanced search operations. |
| **Lab10_DS.cpp** | Final lab combining multiple data structures or implementing higher-level algorithms. |
